AUSTRALIA: How goes the higher education revolution?

Vin Massaro
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a revolution as a dramatic and
wide-ranging change in the way something works. It is still not clear how
Australia=92s higher education landscape might be changed fundamentally by
the conservative blueprint designed by the 2008 Bradley report, but I
suspect it will not approach the revolutionary effects of the Dawkins
reforms begun in 1987 by then Labor Education Minister John Dawkins.
